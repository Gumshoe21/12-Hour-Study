# 12-Hour-Study

- ***12 Hour Study*** is a productivity app that builds off concepts presented in pomofocus.io by introducing new features and a social aspect.

## Technologies Used
- The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with Chakra UI as the UI framework. Redux is used to manage most state, though some localized/non-app relevant state is mangaged with the useState hook.

# Goals

- This app is not meant to reinvent the wheel; as stated above, it builds off existing ideas with the goal of *improving* and *complimenting* what's already out there.
