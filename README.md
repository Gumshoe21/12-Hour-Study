# 12-Hour-Study

- **_12 Hour Study_** is a productivity app that builds off concepts presented in pomofocus.io by introducing new features and a social aspect.

## Technologies Used

- The app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with Chakra UI as the UI framework. Redux is used to manage most state, though some localized/non app-level state is mangaged with the useState hook.

## Goals

- This app is not meant to reinvent the wheel; as stated above, it builds off existing ideas with the goal of _improving_ and _complimenting_ what's already out there.
- This app is also largely meant to be a learning project for myself by challenging me to create something that I and others might actually want to use. This is my first go at implementing the MERN stack alone so I'm not expecting perfection.
- This app will implement Spotify functionality as one of its chief features. This alone probably sets it apart from Pomofocus.
- This app should stay minimalist. After all, it's meant to be a tool to accompany studying rather than take over it. Set your timer, set your music, and forget the rest.
- Stay tuned for more.
